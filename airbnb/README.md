This project aims to look at airbnb data for Vancouver BC to determine if I can build a reliable classification model to predict if a property is contravening new bylaws put in place by the city, and determine which properties should be taken down from the platform or investigated for enforcement.

AirBnB data was acquired from: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
